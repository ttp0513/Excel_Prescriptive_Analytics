<h1> Pro-forma Model Project </h1>

<h2> Project Summary </h2>

<h3>Business Context</h3>
The company operates in a capital-intensive industry where long-term growth depends heavily on timely investment in plant and equipment. With revenue projected to grow steadily through 2030, leadership is evaluating how to scale operations while maintaining financial discipline. However, rising costs, uncertain market conditions, and the timing of debt obligations present challenges to sustaining profitability and liquidity.

To support strategic planning, a pro-forma financial model was developed to simulate the company’s financial performance under multiple investment scenarios. This model integrates key financial drivers, including revenue growth, cost of goods sold (COGS), interest and tax rates, and asset turnover assumptions, to forecast income statement and balance sheet outcomes over a six-year horizon.

<h3> Project Objective </h3>
The objective of this project is to assess how different capital investment strategies affect long-term financial health. Specifically, the model evaluates:
<ul>
<li>Net income performance under varying revenue and cost assumptions: </li>
<li>Total asset growth based on annual plant & equipment additions</li>
<li>Long-term debt exposure tied to investment pacing and interest obligations</li>
</ul>

<h3> Approach </h3>
Using Excel’s What-If Analysis, multiple scenarios were generated to reflect slow, baseline, and fast investment strategies across pessimistic, baseline, and optimistic market conditions.

<h3> Key Insights </h3>

Strategic Investment Timing: Fast-paced capital deployment accelerates asset growth but risks liquidity strain and elevated debt service. A balanced approach yields stronger long-term profitability with manageable leverage.
