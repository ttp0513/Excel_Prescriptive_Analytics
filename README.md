<h1> Excel Prescriptive Analytics Projects </h1>

Welcome to my repository showcasing real-world business problems solved using Excel-based prescriptive analytics. Each project demonstrates how structured decision-making, optimization, and scenario modeling can drive actionable insights, without needing complex code.

## 🚀 Why Excel?

Excel remains a powerful tool for prescriptive analytics—especially when speed, accessibility, and transparency matter. These projects show how far you can go with Solver, scenario tools, and structured logic.

## 🧭 What’s Inside

This repository includes multiple folders containing case studies where Excel was used to:
- Model business decisions
- Optimize outcomes
- Recommend strategic actions based on data

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each folder includes:

## 🧠 Problems Solved

### 1. Pro-forma Model
- **Challenge**: How different investment strategies in plant & equipment influence financial performance and risk exposure, given fluctuating revenue growth and cost assumptions.
- **Tools Used**: Excel What-if Analysis (Data Table & Scenario Manager)  
- **Outcome**: A slower pace of plant & equipment investment leads to higher net income and reduced long-term debt by 2030, at the cost of a smaller total asset base. This reflects a more conservative growth strategy that prioritizes profitability and financial stability over aggressive expansion.

### 2. WIP
